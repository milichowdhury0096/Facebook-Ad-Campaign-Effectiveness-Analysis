# Facebook Ad Campaign Effectiveness Analysis: A Data-Driven Study

## Project Overview
This project evaluates the effectiveness of three Facebook ad campaigns in 2017, focusing on key metrics such as conversion and approved conversion rates. Using A/B testing and regression analysis techniques, the goal is to identify the impact of each campaign and uncover factors influencing outcomes. The project aims to provide actionable insights and recommendations for optimizing future digital marketing efforts on the platform.

## Data Description
The dataset includes information on the three Facebook ad campaigns conducted in 2017. It contains metrics such as impressions, clicks, conversions, approved conversions, and campaign details. The dataset will be analyzed to understand the performance of each campaign and their impact on conversion rates.

## Analysis Techniques
- A/B Testing: Comparing the performance of different ad campaigns to determine their effectiveness.
- Regression Analysis: Identifying factors that influence conversion rates and predicting outcomes based on campaign parameters.
- Visualization: Creating visualizations such as charts and graphs to present insights and trends in the data.

## File Structure
- **KAG_conversion_data**: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- **notebooks/**
  - **Facebook_Ad_Campaign_Analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis and visualization.

## Conclusions
Based on the results of A/B testing and campaign analysis, we can come up with some actionable approach:

- With much higher performance in terms of conversion rate and click through rate found in ad campaign 916 and 936, the company should prioritize scaling them up. This should, obviously, be taken with caution, as we cannot know precisely how the campaigns would change reaching a larger number of audiences.
- Given a great budget, 1178 was able to generate large conversions and impressions. However, it efficiency is far lower than what the other two campaigns can generate with a lower budget. The company should investigate the reason for the lack of engagement and conversions of 1178, especially given that it is exposed to a much larger audience reach.
- The most interested audiences are from the age group 30-34. The company should target this age group for highest user engagement and interactions. On the other hand, other existing age groups should also be investigated to understand the reason for lower interactions with ad.
